### [Project Description](doc/)
This project aims to apply topic modeling to help us understand large text content. The text is a database recording people's happy moments which extends to tons of things that makes people feel happy. The topic comparisons are from age groups, gender, parenthood and marital, so that we could observe more information for different groups of people. Topic modeling is a great tool in this project and could extend more for research topics such as single mom's issues, divorced problems and aging phenomenon.

### [HappyDB Data]
HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments. The goal of the corpus is to advance the state of the art of understanding the causes of happiness that can be gleaned from text.
